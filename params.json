{"name":"Terminal From Here","tagline":"Quickly open up an external terminal window from within NetBeans.","body":"For some reason I like to use the Terminal (aka Command Prompt, if you're on Windows) a lot while I'm developing software. I used it to run scripts on my code, make commits and push them to GitHub and a lot of other stuff.\r\n\r\nIn the past I used to open up the folder that contains my NetBeans project and copy its location to terminal so I could 'cd' into that folder. Since I was doing this quite often, I figured it would be nice to add a feature for this to NetBeans and here it is: Terminal From Here.\r\n\r\n**[TODO]** *Add a downloadable NBM file for easy installation.*","google":"UA-13135527-18","note":"Don't delete this file!
